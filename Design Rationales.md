# Design Rationales
From the initial concept and the design challenge, to the final design of our habit tracker app, SocialHabit, our primary focus remained solid on crafting the app to meet our target users' needs. Throughout the development, we aimed to: 1. integrate all the innovative ideas we had; and 2. improve these ideas based on continuous feedback from our users and survey participants.
The app's interface has evolved considerably from our first Figma sketches, with thoughtful planning given to how each feature would function. This iterative process is evidenced by the significant refinements from the earliest Figma drafts to the last version of the actual app, SocialHabit.
By the third week of development, we had identified our core objectives: learnability, efficiency, minimizing errors, and ensuring user satisfaction. These initial targets were expanded to include other key functionalities, such as:
-the task “migratability” (passing responsibility for tasks from the user to the system),
-recoverability (enabling the user to return to a prior state), and
-shortcuts (accessing commonly used actions easily and/or quickly)
In addressing the detailed needs of our users, we took care not to lose sight of the app's central purpose—to be a useful and efficient tool for our users during their daily routines.
When we first started designing in Figma, our initial ideas and decisions set a strong foundation. By the second week, it was clear that the entire design process had been beneficial, making significant improvements over previous efforts.
A notable change in our final design is the removal of the task deletion slide. We found that this feature wasn't intuitive, requiring us to consider a tutorial for users to understand its benefits fully.
We also decided to remove other features, such as the search bar and the experience (XP) system. Our decision to exclude these from our app was based on their limited benefits to the user. While the XP system could serve as motivation, it didn't effectively assist users in tracking and organizing their habits, which is our app's primary function.

Similarly, we found the search bar to be unnecessary. Given that the app clearly displays tasks for each day of the week and users can easily switch days to view specific tasks with a simple scroll, we concluded that the search functionality was redundant in our app's context.
Additionally, we made small yet impactful adjustments to the buttons. In our early design phases, specifically in the hi-fi black-and-white version, the menu button was simply labeled "menu." The option to add a task was termed "create," even in a previous version of the black-and-white lo-fi, a choice not commonly seen in similar applications; instead, we replaced them with the icons seen in the final design. We have also refined the selection process for days, ensuring it's more precise. Our goal when creating tasks was to maximize their efficiency while retaining all necessary features and functionalities. The introduction of colors and themes has been an interesting aspect of our design process. Despite settling on a particular theme, achieving visual effectiveness remained a priority for us.
Our primary goal was to ensure that our app was as user-friendly and practical as possible. To achieve this, we incorporated all of our concerns into surveys to verify the accuracy, usefulness, and comprehensiveness of our design and features.
For user study questionnaires, the System Usability Scale (SUS), and consent forms, we carefully examined examples that could provide insight. We then tailored these documents to address the specifics of our app, including our unique concerns. This allowed us to gather and analyze data effectively, ensuring our conclusions were well-founded on user feedback and empirical evidence.
